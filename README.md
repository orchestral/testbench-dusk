Laravel Dusk Testing Helper for Packages Development
==============

The Testbench Dusk Component is a simple package that is supposed to help you write tests for your Laravel package using Laravel Dusk.

The package was developed by [Konsulting Ltd](https://github.com/konsulting) and transferred to the Orchestra namespace where we will assist with supporting it in the future. It is in early development and feedback is appreciated.

## Version Compatibility

 Laravel  | Testbench Dusk
:---------|:----------
 5.4.x    | 3.4.x
 5.5.x    | 3.5.x
 5.6.x.   | 3.6.x@dev

## Installation

To install through composer, simply put the following in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "orchestra/testbench-dusk": "~3.4"
    }
}
```

And then run `composer install` from the terminal.

### Quick Installation

Above installation can also be simplify by using the following command:

    composer require --dev "orchestra/testbench-dusk=~3.4"

## Usage

Use the `Orchestra\Testbench\Dusk\TestCase` as the parent class for your test. Optionally, extend that class to provide a custom base class for your project - in there you can perform the application setup you require for your tests.

You will need to make sure that your Laravel application uses the correct `APP_URL` environment variable. You can set this in the `phpunit.xml` file's `php` block as below:
```xml
<php>
    ...
    <env name="APP_URL" value="http://127.0.0.1:8000"/>
    ...
</php>
```

By default, this package will start a server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

#### Selectively running Dusk tests

Browser tests can take a while to run, so you could also separate your tests in your `phpunit.xml` file by providing different testsuites, allowing you to run your Browser tests on demand. For example:
```xml
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Browser">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Browser</directory>
        </testsuite>
        <testsuite name="Feature">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Feature</directory>
        </testsuite>
        <testsuite name="Unit">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Unit</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
```

Run only your browser tests by running phpunit with the `--testsuite=Browser` option.

You can optionally set the default testsuite with the option `defaultTestSuite="Unit"`.

## Advanced Usage

During a test run, this package sets up a separate process using PHP's built in web server, by default at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

We use the calling test class to build up the application to be used when serving the request.

Sometimes you will want to make a minor change to the application for a single test (e.g. changing a config item).

This is made possible by using the `tweakApplication` method on the test, and passing in a closure to apply. At the end of the test, you need to call the `removeApplicationTweaks` method to stop the changes being applied to the server.

An example test (`can_tweak_the_application_within_a_test`) is available in the `tests/Browser/RouteTest.php` test file.
