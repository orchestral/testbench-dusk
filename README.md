Laravel Dusk Testing Helper for Packages Development
==============

The Testbench Dusk Component is a simple package that is supposed to help you write tests for your Laravel package using Laravel Dusk.

The package was developed by [Konsulting Ltd](https://github.com/konsulting) and transferred to the Orchestra namespace where we will assist with supporting it in the future. It is in early development and feedback is appreciated.
